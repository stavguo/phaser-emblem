# [Phaser-Emblem](https://dmellogu.github.io/ftrpg/)

A Phaser3 demo inspired by Fire-Emblem's grid-based movement. There is a lot of progress to be made, but I'll do my best to keep the deployment "playable." It can be played [here](https://dmellogu.github.io/ftrpg/).


## How to Play

### Navigation
* Clicking on a tile and dragging.
* Zooming out with your mouse/trackpad, point your cursor somewhere, and zoom in.

### Character Movement
Select a character by double clicking on them. Once selected, double click on a tinted tile to move them there.
